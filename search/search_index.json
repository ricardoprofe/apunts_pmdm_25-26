It was in version 1.5, Cupcake, that a version name was introduced, and a large number of interface improvements were included, such as the on-screen keyboard, which allowed devices to eliminate physical keyboards. Subsequently, with version 1.6, Donut, the system began to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.</p> <p>Versions 2.0 and 2.2 (Eclair and Froyo) introduced aspects like voice-guided navigation, real-time traffic information, and the bottom dock. Version 3.0, Honeycomb, was launched specifically for larger devices, like tablets, and in version 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, in 2011, this new interface, Holo, was unified for tablets and smartphones, thus entering the era of modern design.</p> <p>But the biggest change was yet to come with versions 5.0 and 5.1, Lollipop, in 2014. Google reinvented Android in what is perhaps the most important update to the system, introducing the Material Design standard\u2014a set of design specifications affecting the operating system, the web, and apps. With Material, flat color designs were introduced to give weight and depth to different interface elements using shadows, layers, or animations.</p> <p>Subsequent versions included some interface improvements, such as split-screen mode in Android 7.0/7.1 (Nougat) and the picture-in-picture floating window in Android 8/8.1 (Oreo). With Android 10, the dessert-based version code names were abandoned, and some aspects of the interface were reinvented regarding gestures and the navigation system.</p> <p>In Android 11, in 2020, substantial changes to privacy arrived, allowing users to grant apps temporary permissions to access location, camera, or microphone only when required, instead of permanently during installation.</p> <p>And in 2021, Android 12 arrived, representing the biggest update since Android 5.0, with the introduction of Material You, which allows for system design personalization to automatically adjust to the user's settings. This means, for example, that the theme's color palette adapts to the user's chosen wallpaper. Additionally, under the hood, it offers a simpler and more granular way to control how apps access our data through the new privacy dashboard.</p> <p>In August 2022, Android 13 (Tiramisu) appeared, evolving Material You and presenting improvements in security, audio, and integration with other Google products. Android 14 (Upside Down Cake), in October 2023, incorporated improvements in customization, privacy, and accessibility.</p> <p>In September 2024, the launch of Android 15 is expected, bringed improvements to the user interface, security, and performance.</p> <p>The last release is Android 16, in June 2025. Android 16's major updates include a new \"Material 3 Expressive\" UI with advanced animations and blur effects, a desktop mode for tablets, and an expanded Linux terminal to run full desktop applications.
